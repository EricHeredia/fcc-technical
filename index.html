      <header>Introduction</header>
      <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.</p>
      <p>It is used for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>web development (server-side),</li>
        <li>software development,</li>
        <li>mathematics,</li>
        <li>system scripting.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Python was designed to for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics. It uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses. Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.</p>
      <p>A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
      <code>
        x = 5
        y = "John"
      </code>
      <p>A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character</li>
        <li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
        <li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )</li>
        <li>Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="if...else_statement" class="main-section">
      <header>if...else statement</header>
      <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Equals: a == b</li>
        <li>Not Equals: a != b</li>
        <li>Less than: a < b</li>
        <li>Less than or equal to: a <= b</li>
        <li>Greater than: a > b</li>
        <li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.</p>
      <p>An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.</p>
      <code>
        a = 33
        b = 200
        if b > a:
          print("b is greater than a")
      </code>
      <p>The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.</p>
      <code>
        a = 200
        b = 33
        if b > a:
          print("b is greater than a")
        else:
          print("a is greater than b")
      </code>
    </section>
    <section id="while_statement" class="main-section">
      <header>while statement</header>
      <p>Python has two primitive loop commands:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>while loops</li>
        <li>for loops</li>
      </ol>
      <p>With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</p>
      <code>
        i = 1
        while i < 6:
          print(i)
          i += 1
      </code>
      <p>The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="for_loops" class="main-section">
      <header>for loops</header>
      <p>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).</p>
      <p>This is less like the for keyword in other programming language, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.</p>
      <p>With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.</p>
      <code>
        fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
        for x in fruits:
          print(x)
      </code>
      <p>Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters:</p>
      <code>
        for x in "banana":
          print(x)
      </code>
      <p>To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,</p>
      <p>The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.</p>
      <code>
        for x in range(6):
          print(x)
      </code>
    </section>
    <section id="Function_declarations" class="main-section">
      <header>Function declarations</header>
      <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.</p>
      <p>You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.</p>
      <p>A function can return data as a result.</p>
      <p>In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:</p>
      <code>
        def my_function():
          print("Hello from a function")
      </code>
      <p>To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:</p>
      <code>
        def my_functino():
          print("Hello from a function")
        
          my_function()
      </code>
      <p>Information can be passed to functions as parameter.</p>
      <p>Parameters are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma.</p>
      <p>The following example has a function with one parameter (fname). When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name:</p>
      <code>
        def my_function(fname):
          print(fname + " Refsnes")
        
        my_function("Emil")
        my_function("Tobias")
        my_function("Linus")
      </code>
      <p>To let a function return a value, use the return statement:</p>
      <code>
        def my_function(x):
          return 5 * x
        
          print(my_function(3))
          print(my_function(5))
          print(my_function(9))
      </code>
